## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I never really got the use of max-width property but using it here made it very
easy and accessible.

```css
.card {
  ...
  max-width: 350px;
}
```

### Continued development

Still very confused on wether using fixed widths is bad or not. Also not sure how
to work with images, they are always super large!

### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This helped me for organizing CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
